Installation / readme for WILDCARD

There are 4 component for this package

ID.MAC  Is an Assembler macro required to assemble each of the assembler
        routines. Put it into a library included in your SYSLIB
        concatenation for the assemblies.

SCCWC001.ASM  Is an assembler subroutine required for WILDCARD. Assemble
        it into an object or call library so that it can be link edited
        into WILDCARD.  Note that this subroutine could be CALLed by any
        program wishing to get an answer to 'does this generic entry
        match this static entry?'

WILDCARD.ASM  Is an assembler routine which runs as a Rexx function to
        set a logical value answering the question  'does this generic
        entry match this static entry?'

WILDCARD.HLP  Is the documentation on how a REXX program can use the
        function

Making WILDCARD available to your rexx program can be as simple as link
editing it to a load library that is within the JOBLIB/STEPLIB
concatenation when the rexx program runs. Myself, I have built a Rexx
function package under the name IRXFLOC which contains all the assembler
written rexx functions for the platform.
